        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A ‘farcell’ in Catalan is a bundle or a bolt of cloth.</p>
        <p>This dish is best prepared with Manresan cabbage, 
            a unique winter vegetable from the Manresa region. 
            Despite often being mistaken for other cabbages like Savoy or kale, 
            it's a distinct hybrid with a highly prized flavor.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 green cabbage</li>
            <li>300 gr ground pork</li>
            <li>20 gr raisins</li>
            <li>20 gr pine-nuts</li>
            <li>1 slice of bread, soaked in milk</li>
            <li>50 gr dry white wine</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 biscuits</li>
            <li>20 gr almonds</li>
            <li>flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the cabbage by cleaning it, removing 12 leaves, trimming the thick stems, boiling them in salted water until bright green and slightly soft, then draining and cooling.</li>
            <li>Combine bread, ground pork, raisins, and pine nuts, seasoning to your liking.</li>
            <li>Form the rolls by placing a tablespoon of the mixture on each cabbage leaf and rolling them up.</li>
            <li>Distribute a spoonful of the mixture onto each cabbage leaf.</li>
            <li>Lightly coat the farcellets in flour and sauté them in hot oil until they are golden brown and fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Create a picada by crushing biscuits, almonds, and garlic in a mortar and pestle, then adding just enough oil to cover and mixing thoroughly into a thick paste.</li>
            <li>Pour dry white wine into a saucepan, reduce the liquid, add the picada and pork, and cook for 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
